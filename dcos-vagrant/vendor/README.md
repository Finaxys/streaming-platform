# Vendored Dependencies

Vagrant makes using Ruby Gems as dependencies a pain. So instead, dependencies are being vendored into this directory and required by relative path.

The following dependencies are vendored:

| Name | Version | Directory | License |
|------|---------|-----------|---------|
| semi-semantic | 1.2.0 | vendor/semi_semantic/ | Apache License Version 2.0 |
