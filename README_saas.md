Our work at the lab (05-2018/09-2018) is contained in the following projects.
In each of them you will find the corresponding documentation (README.md).

We added the following projects to streaming-platform.
  - ansible-dcos (Automatically install and deploy Big Data services on an existing cluster)
  - dcos_vagrant (Quickly provision a cluster on a local machine)
  - stream-layer2 (Data pipeline project getting input from ATOM)

There is also an intermediate project :
  - auto_SAAS (Install Big Data services automatically through Ansible. We developed it when we were still testing technologies compatibility with Ansible. Feel free to check it out)
